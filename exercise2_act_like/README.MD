# 📝 Exercise2 - Act Like ~ 10 minutes

"Act like" involves asking the model to behave as a specific person or role. In this case, we use it to get advice on developing features in Java.

## 1️⃣ Use Case 1: Create a Prompt for the Model to Provide Steps for Developing a JAVA Project and Highlight Key Points

Possible example:
```java
Ask your AI like a JAVA developer to help you secure an API in JAVA
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: 👀
```java
Write your prompt here

What was the response?
```java

## 2️⃣ Use Case 2: Create a Prompt for the Model to Assist by Acting as a Specialized Expert

Possible example:
```java
Act like a web application security expert. What needs to be integrated into a JAVA API to ensure compliance with OWASP standards?
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: 👀
```java
Write your prompt here
```

What was the response?
```java
Write AI response here
```

## 3️⃣ Use Case 3: Compare Your Two Responses and Test Other Response Structures

Possible example:
```java

```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: 👀
```java
Write your prompt here
```
