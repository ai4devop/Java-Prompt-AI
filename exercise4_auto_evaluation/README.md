# 📝 Exercise4 - Self-Evaluation ~ 10 minutes

Self-evaluation involves asking the model to assess itself using specific criteria. In this exercise, we apply this method to TypeScript scenarios.

## 1️⃣ Use Case 1: Create a Prompt for the Model to List Comprehensive Items to Test a Java method

Possible example:

```java
// Ask your AI to give you a list to test this method
// Method that validates an email address
public boolean validateEmail(String email) {
    String emailRegex = "^[^\\s@]+@[^\\s@]+\\.[^\\s@]+$";
    return email.matches(emailRegex);
}
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: 👀
```java
Write your prompt here
```

What was the response?
```java
Write AI response here
```

## 2️⃣ Use Case 2: Ask the Model if It Can Provide More Possibilities

Possible example:

```typescript
Ask the model if it can provide more possibilities.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: 👀
```java
Write your prompt here
```

What was the response?
```java
Write AI response here
```

## 3️⃣ Use Case 3: Ask the Model to Self-Evaluate and Improve Its Response

Possible example:

```typescript
Ask the model to self-evaluate and improve its response.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: 👀
```java
Write your prompt here
```

What was the response?
```java
Write AI response here
```
