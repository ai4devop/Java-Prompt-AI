# 📝 Exercise5 - Meta-Prompt ~ 10 minutes

The meta-prompt involves asking the model to create a prompt itself using specific parameters. This method allows exploring new possibilities while automating prompt creation.

## 1️⃣ Use Case 1: Create a Prompt for the Model to Create a Prompt on a Topic

Possible example:

```typescript
Create a prompt for the model to create a prompt for a topic like the best practice for developing an Java 23 project.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: 👀
```java
Write your prompt here
```

What was the response?
```java
Write AI response here
```

## 2️⃣ Use Case 2: Create a Prompt Asking the Model to Generate a Prompt Combining Multiple Methods of Prompting

Possible example:

```typescript
Create a prompt asking the model to generate a prompt combining multiple methods of prompting.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below: 👀
```java
Write your prompt here
```

What was the response?
```java
Write AI response here
```

## 🕵️‍♀️ Analysis of Provided Examples

***Simple Meta-Prompt:***
The first exercise asks the model to generate an effective prompt for a to-do list of Angular 18 best practices. The solution suggests a well-structured prompt, covering essential aspects like component structure and service management.

***Combined Meta-Prompt:***
The second exercise uses the "act like" and "chain of thought" methods to generate a complex prompt, where the model must think step-by-step and act as an expert. The response demonstrates a thoughtful approach to combining the two techniques, providing detailed results.
