# üìù Exercise5 - Meta-Prompt ~ 10 minutes

The meta-prompt involves asking the model to create a prompt itself using specific parameters. This method allows exploring new possibilities while automating prompt creation.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 1: Create a Prompt for the Model to Create a Prompt on a Topic

Possible example:

```typescript
Create a prompt for the model to create a prompt for a topic like the best practice for developing an Java 23 project.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below:  üëÄ

```typescript
Write an AI prompt to help me generate a to-do list of best practices for developing an Java 23 project.
```

What was the response?

```typescript
Sure! Here is a prompt you can use to generate a to-do list of best practices for developing a Java 23 project:
"Generate a to-do list of best practices for developing a Java 23 project. The list should include tasks related to project setup, code quality, testing, documentation, and deployment. Each task should be clear and actionable, providing specific steps or guidelines to follow. The list should be comprehensive and suitable for both new and experienced developers."
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 2: Create a Prompt Asking the Model to Generate a Prompt Combining Multiple Methods of Prompting

Possible example:

```typescript
Create a prompt asking the model to generate a prompt combining multiple methods of prompting.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below:  üëÄ

```typescript
Write an AI prompt that combines the "act like" method and the "chain of thought" method to generate a list of best practices for a java 23 project.
```

What was the response?

```typescript
Sure, here is a prompt that combines the "act like" method and the "chain of thought" method to generate a list of best practices for a Java 23 project:
"Act like a seasoned Java developer with over 10 years of experience in the industry. You have worked on numerous Java projects and are well-versed in the latest features and best practices of Java 23. Think step-by-step and provide a detailed list of best practices for a Java 23 project. Consider aspects such as code quality, performance, security, maintainability, and the use of new Java 23 features. Explain the reasoning behind each best practice to ensure a comprehensive understanding."
```

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Analysis of Provided Examples

***Simple Meta-Prompt:***
The first exercise asks the model to generate an effective prompt for a to-do list of Angular 18 best practices. The solution suggests a well-structured prompt, covering essential aspects like component structure and service management.

***Combined Meta-Prompt:***
The second exercise uses the "act like" and "chain of thought" methods to generate a complex prompt, where the model must think step-by-step and act as an expert. The response demonstrates a thoughtful approach to combining the two techniques, providing detailed results.
