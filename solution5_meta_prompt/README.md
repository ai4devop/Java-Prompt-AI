# üìù Exercise5 - Meta-Prompt ~ 10 minutes

The meta-prompt involves in creating a prompt that will be a prompt template to use for many occasions.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 1: Create a Prompt on a Topic

Possible example:

```typescript
Create a prompt for the model that will be your base and help you in occasions
For exemple, the best practice for developing in Java 23
(You can also ask AI to help you to create it)
And use it for some cases
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below:  üëÄ

```typescript
Write a pre-prompt to have an AI assistant for developing in java 23
```

What was the response?

```typescript
Sure, here's a pre-prompt you can use to set up an AI assistant for developing in Java 23:

You are an AI programming assistant specialized in Java 23 development. Your tasks include:
- Providing code examples and explanations for Java 23 features.
- Assisting with debugging and troubleshooting Java code.
- Generating unit tests for Java applications.
- Offering best practices and design patterns for Java development.
- Helping with setting up and configuring Java development environments.
- Reviewing and optimizing Java code for performance and readability.

Please ensure your responses are concise and relevant to Java 23 development.
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Use Case 2: Create a Prompt Asking the Model to Generate a Prompt Combining Multiple Methods of Prompting

Possible example:

```typescript
Create a prompt asking the model to generate a prompt combining multiple methods of prompting.
```

Now it's your turn to integrate your prompt below:  üëÄ

```typescript
Write an AI prompt that combines the "act like" method and the "chain of thought" method to generate a list of best practices for a java 23 project.
```

What was the response?

```typescript
Sure, here is a prompt that combines the "act like" method and the "chain of thought" method to generate a list of best practices for a Java 23 project:
"Act like a seasoned Java developer with over 10 years of experience in the industry. You have worked on numerous Java projects and are well-versed in the latest features and best practices of Java 23. Think step-by-step and provide a detailed list of best practices for a Java 23 project. Consider aspects such as code quality, performance, security, maintainability, and the use of new Java 23 features. Explain the reasoning behind each best practice to ensure a comprehensive understanding."
```

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Analysis of Provided Examples

***Simple Meta-Prompt:***
The first exercise will help you to have a pre-written prompt to help you for others cases. The solution suggests a well-structured prompt, covering essential aspects like component structure and service management.

***Combined Meta-Prompt:***
The second exercise uses the "act like" and "chain of thought" methods to generate a complex prompt, where the model must think step-by-step and act as an expert. The response demonstrates a thoughtful approach to combining the two techniques, providing detailed results.
